Recognizing patterns allow us to predict and expect what is coming and this is what helped us survive and evolve through time. One of our biggest traits. Design Patterns in Software Development are no different, those are the patterns observed as a part of designing reusable object-oriented software.

> Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice - Christopher Alexander

Let's say you're the manager of the famous circus in your town. And you want to provide  pre-booking to your show, how are you going to solve this problem?

_TICKETS!!_ You can give all your audience tickets after pre-booking, which they can use as entry on the day of the show. Well, this example is quiet obvious, this solution has existed forever. Whenever there is a question of pre-payment for a service that would be offered in the future, you can use ticketing as a solution. There is a common occurrence in the question which becomes a **Pattern** and a pre-existing solution which can be reused according to the context. This becomes very useful in software development, to record experience, observe patterns in designing object-oriented software.

## Definition:

Design patterns make it easier to reuse successful designs and architectures. Expressing proven techniques as design patterns makes them more accessible to developers of new systems. Design patterns help you choose design alternatives that make a system reusable and avoid alternatives that compromise reusability. _Put simply, design patterns help a designer get a design "right" faster._
