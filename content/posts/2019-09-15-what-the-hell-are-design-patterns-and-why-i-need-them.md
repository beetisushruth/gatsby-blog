  We all (humans) look for patterns every day knowingly or not because pattern
  recognition is the basic mechanism by which our brains function. Recognizing
  patterns allow us to predict and expect what is coming and this is what helped
  us survive and evolve through time. One of our biggest traits.

  Design Patterns in Software Development are no different, those are the
  patterns observed as a part of designing reusable object-oriented software.
