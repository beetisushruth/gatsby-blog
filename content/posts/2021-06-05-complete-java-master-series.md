I know that it's been ages since I wrote my last blog. A lot was happening in my life and I thought I would share all that in this blog. But before that, I was recently feeling happy that I received my first comment on one of my blogs, but turns out it was a troll :(. It basically says "No originality in your blogs, you copy-paste stuff, haha". Well, yes I only write what I learned from the internet, books, or my colleagues. That's my blog's name. Most of my blogs are like notes I like to maintain on select topics.

Anyways, a few months back I got admitted to RIT for my Masters in Computer Science. Yay. And I'm very much looking forward to all the learning and all the amazing people I'm going to meet. Although I've received a few prerequisites in order to start my master's courses.

* **CSCI 603**: Computational Problem Solving
* **CSCI 605**: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
* **CSCI 661**: Foundations of Computer Science Theory

So I need to prepare to attend the bridge examinations for these courses. If you have read a few of my previous blogs, you know that I have written a few blogs on Java before (BufferReader vs Scanner, Features of JAVA 8, Java Messaging Service). I'm going to expand on them and create a complete blog series that is going to help me pass my CSCI-605 and help you with your Object-Oriented Programming.

This is the rough estimate of the topics that I'm going to be writing about, which is basically my test syllabus :P

1. Introduction to Java
2. Java Programming Basics
3. Inheritance
4. Abstraction
5. Polymorphism
6. Encapsulation
7. Exceptions
8. Event Handling
9. Input/Output: Files and Streams
10. Design Patterns (Creational Patterns
    , Structural Patterns, Behavioral Pattern, Concurrency Pattern) (Yay now I can finally finish the Design Patterns series, which I promised like a year ago)
11. Remote Method Invocation Framework (I've no idea what this is)
12. Collection Class Framework

Alright then, time to put coding masks on and get to work.
