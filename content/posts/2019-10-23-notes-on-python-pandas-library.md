  This post is a detailed notes on Pandas,  an open-source Python Library
  providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its
  powerful data structures. The name Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data
  – an Econometrics from Multidimensional data.

Pandas came into existence because of the need for data manipulation, analysis library, as plain python wouldn't cut it. Using Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps in the processing and analysis of data, regardless of the origin of data — load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyse.

There are three important data structures in pandas:

1. **Series:** As the name suggests it's a series of data, 1D labeled homogeneous array, which is size immutable.
2. **DataFrame:** General 2D labeled, size-mutable tabular structure with potentially heterogeneously typed columns.
3. **Panel:** General 3D labeled, size-mutable array. 

DataFrame is the most commonly used data structure in pandas, by using pandas manipulation of multi-dimensional matrices becomes easy.
