Learning python has to be one of the best things that happen to me on my coding journey so far. I had to learn it for machine learning task I was given at the office. But sadly, it becomes very difficult to go back coding in another language after python.

Anyway this post will contain all the notes, I thought I should remember while learning python. ( the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, hence the title :) )
