I also have certain todos that I need to learn:

* Recently I have been working with image processing for some tasks, I will update it soon as a dedicated blog. It will be a opencv image processing related blog.
* Dedicated blogs for Desgin Patterns by GOF, if you never heard of them, you should definitely check them out, if you just started as a developer like me.
* Well, after image processing my goal would be to learn Computer Vision And Deep Learning, there are some projects I've in my mind which I will share soon.
* And System Design would definitely be in this list.

_Here are the references I'm currently using to learn the above topics:_

_1) For Image Processing, a book called Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez And Woods, which seems to be a very good book for beginner and pros alike._

_2) And For Design Patterns, what better book than the book by GOF themselves._

__[https://www.amazon.in/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8](https://www.amazon.in/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8)__

_Also Head First For Design Patterns is also a good reference with a lot of examples._
